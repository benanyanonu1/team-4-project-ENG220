# team-4-project-ENG220
ENG220 Final Group Project Repository

Project Abstract:
  Our group’s assigned topic was violence and security. In light of many recent events, violence and security is a very prominent topic, especially gun violence. Because of this, our group was particularly interested in forming our project around gun-violence related crimes and their potential solutions. We were able to find a suitable dataset on Kaggle called “Gun Violence Data,” which records over 260,000 gun violence incidents with as many details as possible. This data is well-suited for our project since it is relatively recent (as recently as 2018), and contains many categories. While it might be hard to find a complete solution to gun violence that avoids political opinions, it is possible to brainstorm peace-engineering-focused solutions based on our dataset. This project will likely not have any direct impact itself, but it will make many people more informed about the prevalence of gun violence, and hopefully inspire future engineers to keep these ideas in mind as they strive to create peace.
